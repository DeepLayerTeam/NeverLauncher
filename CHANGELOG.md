## 0.40.1 — Client Factory → Build Workspace delivery

- Connect the existing CLI Client Factory, backend Build Workspace persistence, and Admin workflow through a direct server-side transfer of **verified executable client files**. No browser-side ZIP extraction or re-upload is required.
- Re-run the Client Factory CLI verifier for the completed job and compare its verified plan identity before transferring bytes.
- Reject path traversal, symlinks, changing file digests, per-file size violations, duplicate case-insensitive paths, unsupported file ownership, and source/loader/Java/profile mismatches.
- Encrypt files into existing private content-addressed Build Workspace storage; commit the whole workspace's file list only after every object has been read back and authenticated.
- Pin `runtime.launch.classpathStrategy = mojang` and the exact loader metadata path in the same revision-checked workspace commit. Preserve the existing immutable settings rule for ordinary workspace operations.
- Allow the operator to continue through existing Stage → Validate → Build → Sign → Staged Run → Publish, where Desktop and NeverRuntime consume signed, SHA-256-verified releases.
- Add focused negative tests for the transfer paths, profile identity and repository transitions.

**Verification boundary:** Existing CLI materializer tests pass in the local Linux environment. The API test suite cannot run here because the repository requires Go 1.27.3 and its dependencies/toolchain are unavailable. The Desktop/Rust build and a real Minecraft game-to-server launch have not been executed in this environment. Consequently 0.40.1 is source-level implementation work, **not** a certified production/GA release.
